# Neuralize-Your-Network

The purpose of the this analysis is to predict whether or not potential ventures will be successful with our Venture Capital clients using a binary classification model among produced by a neural network.

# Technologies

Python 3.7 and above and has been constructed in the jupyter lab notebook named forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb The following libraries are required:

pandas - for analyzing data

jupyter - for an IDE

tensor flow - for creating neural network

sci-kit learn - for ML model built on top of SciPy

pathlib - for creating object oriented file modules
Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies:

  pip install pandas
  
  pip install jupyterlab 
  
  pip install tensor-flow
  
  pip install sci-kit learn
  
  pip instal pathlib
  
# Usage
